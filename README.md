# Python_api_Challenge

This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

Part 1: WeatherPy

In this deliverable, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. I used the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site. and created a representative model of weather across cities.

I use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the starter code. Next, I created a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Latitude vs. Temperature

Latitude vs. Humidity

Latitude vs. Cloudiness

Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Next, I computed the linear regression for each relationship. Separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude).


Part 2: VacationPy

In this deliverable, I used weather data to plan future vacations. Also, I use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.

The code needed to import the required libraries and load the CSV file with the weather and coordinates data for each city created in Part 1 was used to help get started.

Next I use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and to create map visualizations.
